I decided to pursue a career in control engineering because I received excellent grades in the subject during my undergraduate studies. Consequently, I was responsible for accelerator control and program development at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research.

While considering attending graduate school, I watched the match between AlphaGo and Lee Sedol, which sparked my interest in the field of artificial intelligence. During my time in graduate school, I noticed that both my body and deep learning models were growing in size day by day. As a result, I started exercising and became interested in researching methods to compress deep learning models.

I believe that deep learning has the potential to drive positive change in the world. Therefore, I am currently developing and researching deep learning models that can be applied across various real-world fields.
