I decided to pursue a career in control engineering after receiving high grades in the subject during my undergraduate studies. Consequently, I took on the responsibilities of accelerator control and program development at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research.

As I considered attending graduate school, I watched the match between AlphaGo and Lee Sedol, which sparked my interest in the field of artificial intelligence. Throughout my time in graduate school, I noticed that both my body and deep learning models were growing larger day by day. This prompted me to start exercising and develop an interest in researching deep learning model compression. This curiosity led us to explore effective ways to perform object detection or segmentation tasks, even in resource-constrained environments.

I believe that deep learning has the potential to move the world in a better direction. As a result, I am currently developing and researching deep learning models that can be applied in various real-world fields.
