### â€¢ Goal
#### Development of a deep learning model that can detect specific motion patterns of equipment through DVS, RGB, and ToF sensors
  - \- Image segmentation, object detection model development
  - \- Development of a module that can extract physical values from detected patterns
  - \- Using OpenCV

#### Facility-related data analysis model development
  - \- Detect malfunctions of equipment through physical numerical data of equipment and input sensor data
  - \- Development of anomaly detection model through basic regression model and deep learning model

#### Model lightweight
  - \- Application of model weight reduction method using quantization and knowledge distillation
  - \- Presenting a model capable of fast and stable inference even in low power conditions
