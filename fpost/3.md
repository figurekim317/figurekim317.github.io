### • Goal

#### Designing an Efficient SNN Learning Algorithm for Vertical Synapse Array Structure
   - \- Suggested SNN learning method using knowledge distillation for resource-constrained environment of 3D-CIM
   - \- Implementation of an algorithm to reduce the occurrence of spikes for energy efficiency in model inference
   - \- Compute capability sensitivity analysis


#### Implementation of an artificial neural network inference model that is robust to device noise
   - \- SNN model design robust to time-variant noise generated in 3D CIM
   - \- ECOC-based Noise Robust artificial neural network advancement and ensemble technology implementation
   - Analyze and apply model ensemble technology, which is a type of \- Bayesian model
