## 1. Introduction
- \- All electronic devices such as computers and smartphones are composed of hardware and software.
   - \- Hardware (HW): everything physically in an electronic device
   - \- Software (SW): A collection of commands given to a computer to achieve a specific purpose
- \- When using the software, the computer's CPU, RAM, and other hardware are used to perform the operation requested by the user.
   - \- At this time, the Operating System (OS) allocates hardware resources as needed for the software.
     - \- The operating system manages limited hardware resources such as CPU and RAM and mediates between HW and SW.
     - ex. Windows, MAC, Android, IOS etc.
- \- Linux is also an operating system
   - \- An operating system based on UNIX by Linus Torvals, a Finnish SW engineer.

## 2. Why use Linux?
- \- **Open source**
   - \- Linux is an open source operating system
   - \- Anyone, whether an individual or a corporation, can install and use Linux for free.
   - \- open source movement

- \- **Customizing**
   - \- Linux strictly means the Linux kernel.
     - \- The kernel is a part of the OS that performs the core functions of the OS.
   - \- Only the core functions that Linux OS needs to perform are defined, and the other parts can be customized and used by the user according to his/her own use.

- \- **Stable operation**
   - \- Since it is open source, various users can verify it in real time.

## 3. Linux(UNIX) Required Commands
### 3.1. CLI(Command Line Interface) commands
   - \- Made for i18n (internationalization)
   - \- UTF-8 is used as the default character set
   - \- It is recommended to use the en_US locale as it is affected by the setting of the LANG environment variable

#### File
- \- **Path**
  - \- command
    - `pwd`: print working directory
    - `cd`: change directory
  - `/`: root directory
  - `~`: home directory
  - `-`: previous directory
  - \- Path type
    - \- Absolute path (abs-path): path starting from the root directory
    - \- Relative path: path starting from the current directory (.)

- \- **Check**
   - \- command
     - \- `ls, file, stat, which, find`
   
   - \- file mode bit: 3+9 bit system representing UNIX file permissions
     - \- how to write
       - \- Symbolic mode:
         - How to mark with `rwx` symbol
         - Consists of owner, group, and others parts, each with 3 spaces
         - `-r`: readable, `-w`: writable, `-e`: executable
       - \- Octal mode: A method of expressing bits in octal notation

    - \- `stat`: outputs status of file, meta data of file
      - \- meta data: Modifying information, not content (file name, creation time, permissions)
    
    - \- `touch`: update meta data of file, create an empty file if file does not exist
    
    - \- `find`: find directory
      - `-name filename`: search for files with the same name as filename
      - `-size n`: search for files of size n
      - `-mtime n`: search for files with modified time n
      - `-inum n`: Search for files with inode number n
      - `-max(min)depth level`: Search for files with a maximum (minimum) depth of level in the subdirectory of the location to be searched
      - $ex1.$ `find . -name '*k.data' -a -size 1M` (-a: AND, -o: OR)
      - $ex2.$ `find -name "*.tmp" -exec rm {}\;`
        - \- `*.tmp`files are put in `{}`
        - \- The meaning of `\` is that the command is executed while searching one by one.
        - \- `\+` finds everything and executes the command at once
        
      - practice 1. Find general files whose contents have been changed within the last 24 hours under the current directory and save the list as mtime_b24.txt file
        - `find ./ -mtime -1 -type f > mtime_b24.txt`
      - practice 2. If it goes beyond the 3rd level under the current directory, it is not searched, and all files that satisfy the condition are copied to the `~/backup` directory.
        - `find ./ -maxdepth 3 ... -exec cp {} ~/backup \;`

- \- **stdio** (standard input/output)
  - File channel: channel for input/output to file
    - \- A kind of virtualization layer that allows standardized input/output methods to be used to input/output channels to files without being directly transferred to hardware.
    - \- file channel: object with meta information for input/output to a file
    - \- Enables simplicity of I/O interface in C language

  - **File descriptor** (often used as file descriptor, fd)
    - \- Unique idenfifier attached to file channels, named numerically
    - \- Starting from positive number 0 and increasing
    - \- Reserved file descriptors: 0 (stdin), 1 (stdout), 2 (stderr)
    - \- The fd value is given within the process. Can't I open the same file twice?
      - \- Even if the same process opens the same file, a new pd value is assigned. It's possible, but there's a possibility of overlapping updates.
    - used as communication between PIPE processes

    - \- A type of IPC (inter-process communication)
      - Anonymous pipe
        - serial connection of processes `(A|B|C)`
        - Temporarily created and destroyed pipes
        - Created by using `|` (vertical bar) in the shell.
        - Ex. `find ~ | wc -l`
          - `find ~`: find all files under the home directory
          - `|` Since there is a pipe, since it is wc (word count), it is per line, so I want to know how many files are under the home directory.
          - The output of the find command (stdout) is concatenated with the input (stdin) of the `wc` command.
          - Has the same meaning as `find ~ > tmp.txt; wc -l < temp.txt; rm tmp.txt`.
          - fd: 1 is connected to fd: 0 via a pipe
          - When using the `wc -l` option, the number of lines is counted.
      
      - Named pipes
        - In Unix, the implementation of a named pipe is called a FIFO pipe.
        - It is structured like a file, so there is a path+filename.
        - Expresses that having a path is named.
        - `mkfifo` or `POSIX C API`
  - **Redirection**
    - Link the direction of a channel to another place
    - `A > B` : connect (save) A's stdout to file B
      - ex. `ls -a > ls.txt`
    - `A < B` : link A's stdin to file B
    - `A >> B`: direction is the same as ">", append mode
      - ex. `strace ls 2> strace.txt`
        - `2>` means a command that connects file descriptor number 2 to a file.
        - Save the output of stderr, which is fd 2, to a file.

  - `cat`: default filter to freely link stdout to files
    - Used to output the contents of a file to stdout
    - Used to redirect input from stdin and output it to a file
    - $ex$. `cat ~/.bashrc`
    - $ex$. `cat > hello.txt` Then, if you write Hello world and do `^D`, Hello world is entered into hello.txt and exited. 


- \- **Change data**
  - \- command
    - \- `cp, mv, rm, mkdir/rmdir, ln`
    - \- `mkdir`: make directory
    - \- `rmdir`: remove directory (In many cases, files and directories are deleted together with `rm -rf` instead of `rmdir`.)
    - \- `cp`: copy
    - \- `mv`: move, rename
    - \- `rm`: remove

- \- **Meta change**
  - \- command
    - \- `chmod`: change mode 
    - \- `chown, chgrp`: change owner/group

- \- **Archive**
  - \- `tar`
    - An archive is a grouping of multiple files.
    - `tar -ctxv`
      - `-c` (create): create an archive
      - `-t`(test) : test the archive
      - `-x` (extract) : Extracts a file from an archive
      - `-v` (verbose): output detailed information (not used in practice)
      - `f archive-file`: Archive file name to input/output `--exclude file`: Exclude the file from the target
    - $ex$. `tar c *.c > arc_c.tar == tar cf arc_c.tar *.c` (just give the `f` option. `*.c` files go into `arc_c.tar`)

- \- **Compress**
  - \- `gzip, zstd`
    - The compression rate is `xz > bzip2 > zstd > gzip > lz4`
    - **xz**: Compression rate is good, but slow.
    - **zstd**: used a lot these days
    $ex$. The classic way to use tar and gzip together
    - compression: `tar c /etc/*.conf | gzip -c > etc.tar.gz`
    - release: `gzip -cd etc.tar.gz | tar x`
